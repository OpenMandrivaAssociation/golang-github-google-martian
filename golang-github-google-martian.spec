%global common_description %{expand:
Martian Proxy is a programmable HTTP proxy designed to be used for testing.

Martian is a great tool to use if you want to:

 - Verify that all (or some subset) of requests are secure
 - Mock external services at the network layer
 - Inject headers, modify cookies or perform other mutations of HTTP requests 
   and responses
 - Verify that pingbacks happen when you think they should
 - Unwrap encrypted traffic (requires install of CA certificate in browser)

By taking advantage of Go cross-compilation, Martian can be deployed anywhere 
that Go can target.}
